# README for Online Marketplace

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Online Marketplace project! This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation for building and maintaining an online platform where users can buy and sell products. The platform is designed with a focus on user experience, integrating secure payment processing and a responsive design to ensure accessibility across various devices.

### Key Features:
- User-friendly interface for both buyers and sellers
- Secure payment processing integration
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility
- Advanced search and filter options
- User authentication and account management

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
- Git
- Node.js and npm
- A modern web browser

### Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourproject/online-marketplace.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd online-marketplace
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end-to-end tests
These tests cover the full functionality of the application, from user authentication to transaction processing.

### And coding style tests
These tests ensure that the coding standards and styles are consistently maintained.

## Deployment
